# GoPro
# The original aim of this project was to utilize the basic functionality of Anki’s Cozmo Robot 
# with a GoPro Hero7’s voice control, creating a unit capable of recording high-definition footage 
# in a variety of applications. The original idea for this project stemmed from home security. 
# By having Cozmo take commands, setting time parameters and returning to its charger, the combination of Cozmo 
# and a GoPro record and save standard videos, time lapse videos, and photographs. While this project 
# focused on home security and relatively basic commands, the unit of Cozmo and a GoPro could be applied to 
# film short clips featuring other robots/objects and taking footage of small spaces.
